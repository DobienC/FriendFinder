# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a project which the user can use to find a "friend." The user will provide their name, an image link, and fill out a survey. Upon completing all three of those steps, FriendFinder will return a match with a name and picture.

## Technology Used
FriendFinder utilizes express and path. The project's focus was on the convention of making large scale full stack projects which would consist of a front end, back end, and a database. Even though the scale of the project wasn't large, linking each file was challenging. FriendFinder is deployed on Heroku.
